# ][ THE TUNNELS ][

Take a journey through the Malabar Battery - its history is more alive than you might think!

THE TUNNELS was my first semester major work submission for the Master of Interactive and Digital Media postgraduate degree at The University of Sydney's Sydney College of the Arts.

This was in 2002. The course no longer exists and the site requires Flash, which also no longer exists :)
